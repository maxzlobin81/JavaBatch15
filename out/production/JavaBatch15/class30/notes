Set:
    Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are three main types of sets 1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3)TreeSet
HashSet(most widely used):
    Upside: Speed it's the fastest
    downside: It does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: maintains the insertion order.
    Downside:  Slower than HashSet
TreeSet:
    Upside: keeps the data sorted
    Downside: it's slower than all.
Map:
    Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets we have three main types of maps
    as well 1)HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap  3) TreeMap
HashMap(most widely used):
    Upside: Speed it's the fastest
    downside: It does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: maintains the insertion order.
    Downside:  Slower than HashSet
TreeMap:
     Upside: keeps the data sorted
     Downside: it's slower than all.
